\emph{
Internet of Things (IoT) can be defined as the interconection of sensitive devices and actuators with a common purpose, such as building automation, industrial process control, and intelligent transportation. % a vision, architectural...
As the user of a system is included as an active participant of the IoT environment, it can contribute with the system by providing informations that the devices, by themselves, don't have the capacity to obtain such as variable environmental features, their specificities and the human perceptions about them.
 By using the informations provided by the human user it is possible that the system could gain more data about the environment, community and the space that it works in, improving it's capabilities of decision making after processing the data supplied by the network of sensors and the data provided by the users, collaboratively.
  In the persuit of this objective, the following steps were achieved with the development of: (1) a small scale IoT environment;
  (2) the SenseHera system, a web system for aquisition, storage and access of informations provided by the IoT network;
  (3) a module that evaluates the quality of a sensor, based on it's disponibility, and regularity of sensors using the informations provided by the sensors and the users. After the data collection period (ninety five days) the score provided by the system was compared to the score obtained with a tool hat is vastly used, in industry context, to calculate equipment effectiveness.
